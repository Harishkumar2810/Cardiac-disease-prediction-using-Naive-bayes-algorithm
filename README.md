# 🫀 Cardiac Disease Prediction using Naive Bayes

## 📘 Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease using machine learning. We use a **Naive Bayes classification algorithm** on a medical dataset with features such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and more.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Project Structure

## 🔍 Problem Statement
To develop a prediction model that assists medical practitioners in early detection of heart disease using patient health records.

## 📊 Features Used
- Age
- Resting blood pressure
- Serum cholesterol
- Fasting blood sugar
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- Chest pain type

## 🔁 Workflow
1. Load and clean the dataset
2. Handle null and duplicate values
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Feature selection
5. Train-test split
6. Apply Naive Bayes model
7. Evaluate performance (confusion matrix, accuracy)

## ✅ Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: 88%
- **Precision**: 82%
- **Confusion Matrix**:
   
## 📌 Insights
- Age and cholesterol levels are significant predictors
- The model performs well with balanced precision and recall

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Try logistic regression and compare models
- Tune parameters using GridSearchCV
